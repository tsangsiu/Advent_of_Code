Part 1

Steps:
- Reorganize the given input
- For each list (branch), count the orbits

To count:
- For each branch,
  - Calculate (#object - 1) * #object / 2
  - Until we get to the main branch (the one that starts with COM)
    - Locate the branch the contains the current branch head, excluding the current branch
    - Calculate (#object - 1) * (the index position of the head of the current branch of the located branch)
    - Repeat the above with the located branch
- Sum the above
